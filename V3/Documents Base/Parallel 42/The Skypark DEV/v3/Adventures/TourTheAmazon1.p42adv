I\u0027m David, and I\u0027d like to invite you to tour...The Amazon River.\n\n20% of the ocean\u0027s fresh-water supply flows thru the Amazon river system; this astonishing percentage has earned it the nickname of The River Sea.\n\nYour journey begins at the western coast of South America in Peru and will take you north towards the Headlands of The Amazon River. Once at the Headlands, you\u0027ll closely track The Amazon into Brazil.

Recent geological studies suggest that the Amazon River used to flow in the opposite direction - from east to west for millions of years. Eventually, the Andes Mountains formed, blocking its flow to the Pacific Ocean and causing it to switch directions to its current mouth in the Atlantic Ocean. Interesting fact, the end of a river is its mouth!\n\nToss your map out the window, and turn off the GPS; you can now follow The Amazon to your next destination.","Path":"david_amazonpt1_headwaters.mp3","DonePlayingActions":[]}},{"UID":50098131,"Action":"audio_speech_play","Params":{"Delay":0,"Type":"adventures","Name":"David","NameID":"david","URL":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2s36e6o12osly35/david_amazonpt1_end.mp3","Transcript":"Well done on Part 1, and welcome to Brazil.
