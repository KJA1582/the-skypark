The Aleutians are also rich in WWII history, but more on that later. Speaking of conflict, you will be closer to Moscow than Washington, DC, by the end of this mini-tour!\n\nExpect savage, untamed lands with active volcanos, jagged coastlines, and harsh climates on your journey to Attu Island. The climate in this archipelago is known for high winds, heavy precipitation, and almost constant fog. I hope you\u0027ve made a good aircraft choice; heating options and modern avionics will quickly become your most cherished comforts.\n\nOK, time to get going!","Path":"david_aleut_start","DonePlayingActions":[]}},{"UID":16557494,"Action":"trigger_engine_stop","Params":{"EnterActions":[53979479]}},{"UID":53979479,"Action":"adventure_milestone","Params":{"Label":"Park \u0026 Shutdown","SuccessActions":[99071313]}},{"UID":99071313,"Action":"audio_speech_play","Params":{"Delay":0,"Type":"adventures","Name":"David","NameID":"david","URL":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/27k5virraa3fp62/david_aleut_middle.mp3","Transcript":"It\u0027s me again,\n\nIt\u0027s been relayed that you\u0027re halfway thru The Aleutian Islands Tour, and you\u0027re still in one piece, brilliant flying!\n\nIt\u0027s not uncommon to get trapped on one of the layovers between destinations due to inclement weather; you may be waiting days for conditions to improve.

The outbreak of WWII brought about dramatic change for everyone in the region. In 1942, as one of the only two invasions of the United States during World War II, the Japanese occupied the islands of Attu and Kiska.\n\nThe U.S. Army responded by setting up a base on Adak to use as a staging ground to dislodge Japanese forces from the Northern Pacific, alongside Canadian forces. At the height of the war, more than 100,000 American and Canadian soldiers were stationed in the region.\n\nAs you fly over the next few islands, keep an eye out for abandoned submarine bases, the foundations of massive complexes used to house soldiers, and many bombing craters.

Roads, ports, and airfields were improved or constructed to facilitate the transportation of troops and supplies. \n\nHowever, many people are unaware of the forced evacuation of the native Aleut people by Japanese and American forces. The Aleut Restitution Act of 1988 was an attempt by Congress to compensate the survivors. In 2017, the U.S. Government formally apologized for the internment of the Aleut people and their treatment in the camps. \n\nAre you wondering why you haven\u0027t flown the rest of the islands? Well, most of the Aleutian Islands belong to the U.S. state of Alaska, but the ones east of here belong to Russia.
